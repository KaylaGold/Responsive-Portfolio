            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img class="image-responsive" src="./assets/images/kayla.jpeg">

            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kayla Goldner, and I am currently a UCSD Extension Coding Boot Camp student. My aspiration
                is to become a full stack web developer, and use these skills to assist others. The majority of my occupational
                and educational background is composed of the medical field because I truly enjoy helping people. I originally
                thought that I could only make a difference in the lives of others, by literally saving their lives. I was
                enlightened by the idea that learning the skills of a full stack web developer could also be used to improve
                the lives of others by making workflow drastically easier and more efficient.
            </p>

            <p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology from the University of California San Diego with a minor in psychology.
                I also have a license as an Emergency Medical Technician. I was not joking when I said that I wanted to help
                people by literally saving their lives. With this transition, I am also interested in continuing my education
                in this field by supplementing my studies with UCSD Extension courses as languages go obsolete.
            </p>
